    <!-- <section class="qa-section p-4 mb-4">
        <h4>How Do Top Brands Make Traditional Marketing Methods Work?</h4>
        <p>We have witnessed many start-ups from the FMCG and E-Commerce sectors emerging victorious, battling their way to enter the market with a bang. The question that haunts newly launched start-ups is how these companies managed to survive the cutthroat competition.
        </p>
        <p>Tech giants like Zomato, Amazon, and Big Basket have successfully created a vivid impression of their brand. Although these brands operate largely in the digital space, they continue to use traditional marketing methods. In the initial stages, start-ups often stick to conventional marketing to make people aware that they exist and offer specific services.
        </p>
        <p>Traditional marketing techniques are not only restricted to print media, television, and radios, but also include emails and displaying brochures on buses and trains. In short, advertisements are placed where they grab the maximum attention. Even today, when electronic mediums fail to deliver, print media steps in. In rural areas with limited digital resources, print media becomes the key source of information.
        </p>
        <p>Companies like Amazon and Big Basket continue to advertise in newspapers. Dominos and Pizza Hut distribute discount coupons through pamphlets. Traditional marketing helps companies connect with the local audience and allows face-to-face interaction with potential buyers. It also enables product testing, where consumers can check the quality firsthand.
        </p>
        <p>Chennai has become a hub for start-ups, and to reach a wide audience, every company needs a strategist to promote their products and services effectively. <a href="https://www.baleenmedia.com">Baleen Media</a>, a renowned advertising agency in Chennai, offers a range of services from traditional to digital marketing, helping brands create a transparent image and reach their target audience.</p>
